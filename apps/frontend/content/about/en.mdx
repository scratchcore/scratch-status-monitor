# Scratch Status Monitor (SSM)

Scratch Status Monitor (SSM) is a status page system designed to monitor the operational state of various [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) features and present that information to users in a clear, understandable way.

## <RiTargetLine className="inline-block pb-1" size={30} /> Purpose

People who use Scratch regularly often run into issues like:

- Cloud variables are unavailable
- Trends are not updating
- Projects are not loading
- Comments cannot be posted

When these issues occur, the biggest challenge is **not knowing where the cause is**:

- Is there a problem with my local environment?
- Is there a problem with Scratch's servers?
- Is this a temporary outage or a longer-term issue?

To address these inconveniences, SSM **visualizes Scratch service status in real time**.
