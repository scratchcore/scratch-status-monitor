# Operations and Support

Scratch Status Monitor (SSM) is an unofficial, community-based project aimed at continuously monitoring the operational status of Scratch-related services and making outages or slowdowns visible.

This page explains SSM's current operational status and why we are asking for financial support.

## Project Operations Structure

- Operating organization: ScratchCore
- Project: Scratch Status Monitor (SSM)
- Operator: Individual (student)

SSM does not receive investment or grants from specific companies or organizations, and is developed and maintained as a **non-profit project run by an individual**.

## Current Operational Status

During pre-release test operations, SSM reached Cloudflare limits due to higher-than-expected traffic and request volume.

To address this issue and provide stable service, we have upgraded to a **paid Cloudflare plan**.

### Main Ongoing Costs

- Cloudflare (paid plan)
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure costs
- Additional costs for future scaling

## Why We Are Asking for Support

The operator is a student and does not have a stable income.
Current operating costs are being covered **from part-time job income**.

At the same time, we need to balance:

- Savings for future education and living expenses
- Ongoing project operations
- Service stability and reliability

Balancing all of these through personal funding alone has limits.

For this reason, we are asking for **financial support within a comfortable range**.

## About Supporting

All SSM features are available **even if you do not provide support**.
Support is entirely optional and never mandatory.

Funds received through support are used only for the following purposes:

- Covering infrastructure costs
- Stable service operations
- Future feature improvements and maintenance

You can currently support us through the following method:

</a>

## Cost Overview

<Callout>
Actual expenses vary depending on access volume and monitoring frequency.
</Callout>

Operating SSM involves ongoing costs such as the following.

### Fixed Costs

- **Domain cost**  
  Approx. **$8 / year**

### Variable Costs

- **Backend and frontend related services (Cloudflare, etc.)**  
  Approx. **$5+ / month**  
  * Depends on usage and traffic volume

These costs are used directly to maintain stable service operations and monitoring accuracy.

## Relationship with the Terms of Service

This page is intended to explain SSM's operational status and the background behind support requests.

For service usage conditions, disclaimers, and legal handling, the [Terms of Service](/policies/terms) take precedence.

## Final Note

SSM aims to create an environment where anyone can accurately understand Scratch's current status.
If you find value in this project, support in any form would be a great encouragement.

Thank you for your continued support of Scratch Status Monitor.
